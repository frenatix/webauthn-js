# webauthn-js: A webauthn server lib for node.js

## Motivation
When I was looking for a server implementation of [webauthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) in JS, I stumpled over an [webauthn example app] (https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/webauthnsample) made by the Microsoft Edge team. In contrast to other server implementations in JS it worked straight away with my FIDO2 authenticators. So I decided to extract the code and build a server lib.
